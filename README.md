# Optime Player

This is a web application for playing music from Nintendo DS ROMs. 

Thanks a lot to the https://github.com/pret/pokediamond project for providing reverse engineered source code of the software side of the DS sound system.

### I made new features with AI

Here is the list.
- Dark mode 
- Mute/Solo button (Right click to toggle solo)
- Fullscreen visualizer is now can visualize velocity and pitch bend
- Volume slider
- Gain meter
- `video-exporter.js`is working
- Mobile compatible

Maybe that's it.

Feel free to make issue. (But English is not my mother tongue)
